                According to Greek biographer, Diogenes Laërtius, Socrates was born on "the sixth day of Thargelion”. However, the exact year of his birth is not known. Historians believe that he was born sometime between 471 and 469 BC, majority of them holding 470 BC as his birth year.
                He was born in Alopece, a suburb located just outside the city wall of Athens, into the Antiochis tribe. According to tradition, his father, Sophroniscus, was a stone mason, a fact that is often doubted by modern scholars.
                His mother, Phaenarete, was a ‘maia’, which loosely translated means a midwife. Since he was not from a noble family, it has been assumed that he joined his father’s profession after acquiring basic education.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a young man, Socrates is believed to have shown a thirst for knowledge, acquiring the writings of Anaxagoras, a leading contemporary philosopher. According to his disciple Plato, he also studied rhetoric with Aspasia, the talented mistress of the great Athenian leader, Pericles.
                As required by the Athenian law, Socrates also served as hoplite or citizen soldier at the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), fighting with shield, long spear and face mask at Delium, Amphipolis, and Potidaea.
                During the war, he showed tremendous courage, a trait that remained with him for the rest of his life. In between fighting in the war, he returned to Athens, where he continued with trade. Concurrently, he started exploring philosophy.

            <p>
                It is not known why or when Socrates started his intellectual pursuit; but according to Xenophon, he soon started visiting the workshops surrounding the central public space to meet the merchants there. Here, he met Simon the Shoemaker, who later became his disciple and wrote his first ‘Dialogue’.
                
                Socrates had a unique teaching method. Instead of lecturing, he would ask questions and then discuss possible answers. They would lead to further questions and eventually to further answers and finally into a deeper understanding of the subject. The process later became known as ‘Socratic Method’.
                <br>
                <br>
                Gradually, he started becoming popular, especially among the city’s youth, gathering around himself select band disciples, most famous of them being philosopher Plato and historian Xenophon. Slowly, he began to ignore his original trade, devoting himself entirely to philosophy.
                There is confusion about how he supported himself in this later phase of his life. While Xenophon and Aristophanes wrote that he accepted payment from his students, Plato had refuted the charge, citing his poverty as proof. His wife was also known to complain about his lack of money.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 423 BC, he became known to the broader public through Aristophanes’ play, ‘Clouds’. In this caricature, he was depicted as a scruffy and untidy fool, whose philosophy amounted to teaching how to get out of debts. While the second part was unfair, he indeed cut a strange figure in Athens.
                With long hair, upturned nose and bulging eyes, he moved around the city, barefooted and unwashed, asking questions to the elite and to the commoners alike, seeking to arrive at the truth. 
                <br>
                <br>
                His young disciples enjoyed the debates, relishing the fact he always defeated those who were considered wise.
                In spite of his fame and popularity, Socrates did not consider himself wise. Therefore, he was surprised when his friend Chaerephon asked the famous Oracle at Delphi if there was anybody wiser than Socrates and the Oracle answered that there was none wiser than him.
                To prove the Oracle wrong, he now started asking questions to those who were perceived to be wise. Shortly, he came to the conclusion that he was wise because he knew that he was ignorant while those who thought themselves wise did not know it and so they were fools.

                Socrates had always stayed away from politics. But in 406 BC, he was made a member of the boule, which in ancient Greece was a council consisting of 500 citizens entrusted with running the daily affairs. This was the only known instance of him holding public office.
                During his tenure, the generals of Athenian army were brought to trial allegedly for failing to rescue surviving sailors during a storm. In the first round of the trial the generals won sympathy.
                Before the second round began, it was decided that the assembly should vote on their guilt or innocence without further debate.
                <br>
                <br>
                The decision, although unconstitutional, was taken on political compulsion. It was important for the ruling elite to blame somebody for their defeat in the Peloponnesian War.
                By chance, Socrates was the epistates, the supervisor of the debate, on the day that the generals were put to final trial. Although he tried to save them, declaring that he would do nothing which was against the law, his attempt was outmaneuvered and the generals were executed.
                <br>
                <br>
                When in 404 BC, the Oligarchy of Thirty came to power they started feeling threatened by Athenian general, Leon of Salamis. To put him out of their way they ordered Socrates and four others to bring Leon from Salamis to Athens so that he could be put to death.
                Socrates, whose whole concern was not to do anything unjust or impious, refused to obey the order and went home. In Plato’s ‘Apology’, it had been said that he could have been put to death for this disobedience. He was simply saved because the government fell shortly thereafter.

            <p>
                Socrates’ unorthodox political viewpoints and willingness to expose the ignorance of others created many enemies. This led to his arrest and trial. This trial was sensationalised in the dialogues of Plato. Plato paints a picture of a philosopher perfectly detached from the fear of death and committed to the truth. Shortly before his death, Socrates said:
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        “The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways — I to die and you to live. Which is the better, only God knows.”
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
                When Socrates was found guilty of ‘corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens and of ‘impiety’ He calmly accepted the verdict and rather than try and escape the death penalty – he accepted the hemlock poison. If Socrates had repudiated his beliefs, he could have been free; he could also have tried to escape, but as a philosopher, he felt it more important to stick to his beliefs. He also felt a social contact with the state of Athens, and therefore should willingly meet his fate. Socrates’ last words were:
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        “Crito, we owe a rooster to Asclepius. Please, don’t forget to pay the debt.”
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>Asclepius was the Greek god for curing illness. This could have meant Socrates saw death as freedom for the soul. Others interpret it as meaning that his death was a purifying remedy for Athens’ misfortune and mistakes.</p>
